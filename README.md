A curated collection of essential JavaScript interview questions and concepts. This repository is designed to help you prepare for technical interviews by covering foundational and advanced JavaScript topics.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

### 📌 JavaScript Execution Context

* Understanding the **call stack**
* Phases of execution: **Creation** and **Execution**
* Role of **Lexical Environment**, **Variable Environment**, and **Scope Chain**

### 🌐 Global Execution Context

* What happens when a script starts executing
* The `window` object (in browsers)
* Global variables and functions

### 🎈 JavaScript Hoisting

* What gets hoisted (variables and functions)
* `var` vs `let` vs `const` hoisting behavior
* Common pitfalls and interview examples

### 🕳️ Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

* How `let` and `const` behave in block scope
* Why accessing variables before declaration throws an error

### ⚡ Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

* What is an IIFE and why it's used
* Syntax and common use cases (e.g., to avoid polluting global scope)

### ❓ JavaScript Interview Questions

* Real-world interview questions on the above topics
* Code snippets and explanations
* Common gotchas and best practices

### ⚙️ JavaScript Engine Working

* How the JavaScript engine parses and executes code
* Differences between engines (V8, SpiderMonkey, etc.)
  
### 📚 JavaScript Call Stack

* What is the call stack?
* How function invocation and return works
* Stack overflow errors and recursion

### 🌐 JavaScript Browser WebAPIs

* What are Web APIs (DOM, setTimeout, fetch, etc.)
* How the browser interacts with JavaScript
* Role of the environment in async operations

### 🌀 Task Queue & Microtask Queue

* Event loop explained with examples
* Difference between task queue (setTimeout, setInterval) and microtask queue (Promises, queueMicrotask)
* Priority and execution order

### ⏱️ Working with Promises and Timers

* Creating and chaining promises
* Timers (setTimeout, setInterval) and how they really work with the event loop

### 🎯 Use Case
